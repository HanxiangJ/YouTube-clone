First web design project, completed by following a tutorial on YouTube （https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=17128s）. 
In this project, I learned a lot of basic knowledge about HTML and CSS, as well as their interconnections. 
Throughout the project, I extensively used <div> elements to separate different sections, making the webpage look richer and more modern. 
I also challenged myself with the recently introduced CSS Grid, to better accommodate various screen sizes of mobile phones and tablets.
